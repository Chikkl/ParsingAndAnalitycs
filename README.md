# ParsingAndAnalitycs

This is an application for parsing and processing the data received from the site hh.ru.

To install the necessary dependencies, being in the root of the project, enter the command in the console:
pip install -r requirements.txt

To run venv, enter one of the commands in the console while at the root of the project:
- for linux and mac: source bin/activate
- for windows:
     - when working in cmd: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     - when working in powershell: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

To stop working with venv, enter the command in the console:
deactivate

At the moment, only the parsing function works. More functionality will be added soon.

To start parsing, go to the main.py file and run it. 

p.s Good luck, this will take some time.
